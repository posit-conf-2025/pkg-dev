Take an existing package (your own, something you cloned today, or a package you use):

* Study the existing user interface (which functions are used?).
* Incrementally convert the UI-providing functions (e.g. `message()` or `stop()`) to its cli equivalent.

Look at the cli documentation, especially:

* cli's articles: <https://cli.r-lib.org/articles/index.html>
* Help topics in the "Introduction" section here: https://cli.r-lib.org/reference/index.html

Find a couple of cli functions or techniques that intrigue you and use GitHub code search to look for examples of them in the wild.
