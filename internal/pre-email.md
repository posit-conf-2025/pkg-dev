Hi everyone,

Welcome to the "Package Development: The Rest of the Owl" workshop at posit::conf(2025). I’m very excited to see you in Atlanta next week!

This GitHub repository will be our home base during the workshop and I encourage you to bookmark it now:

https://github.com/posit-conf-2025/pkg-dev

Soon (but not yet, apparently) it will also reachable via this shortlink:

https://pos.it/pkg-dev-conf25

Before you come to Atlanta, please read through the README of the GitHub repo linked above. Especially, I ask you to:

1) Read the Description and Audience sections and ensure that this workshop feels like a good fit for you. If you feel you would get more out of a different workshop, please reach out to the organizers at conf@posit.co and let them know you're interested in switching workshops.

2) Work through the Prework section to set up your computational environment on the laptop you are bringing to the workshop. The conference WiFi will experience significant traffic in the first hour of the workshops, so the fewer packages you need to install morning-of, the easier. If you show up with a locked down laptop that won’t allow you to install packages or download files, that is very problematic and can seriously undermine your workshop experience.

3) We will be using Discord as our main communication method during the workshop. To make the process go smoothly:
Please sign up for a Discord account (https://discord.com/) if you don’t already have one.
Ensure your display name is the one you used to register for the conference.
Put "Package Development: The Rest of the Owl" in your "About Me."
Click on the "Join the Discord!" link in the conf event portal: http://pos.it/conf-event-portal
Join our workshop channel #workshop-pkg-dev.
See you soon!
